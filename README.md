# better-lists - Web App Project Using React, Node, and Express

## Custom web app for keeping track of things using lists, uses local JSON file as database

This is a project I coded for fun, and shows my skills in React with Redux, Node, Express, and responsive web design.
Although I know how to incorporate MongoDB, I decided to use a local JSON file to make it easy for anyone to install
and run the program, without having to manually input or change any code to connect to a database. The front-end is made
with React components, and makes use of React Router to travel between Lists and Bootstrap to style and make the UI reponsive.
The back-end is made with Express, and handles the requests and CRUD operations on the database. Below is a video sample of 
the web app in action.

## How to use this project on your computer

1. Clone the github repo or download the zip file containing the code
2. Have two tabs of your terminal open, one on the directory for the server folder, and the other for the better-lists
   folder, containing the public, src, and package files
3. Install the node packages on both folders using - `npm i` (you may ignore any warnings as the project still works)
4. Start the server first on the terminal tab in the server directory, using `npm start`
5. Start the front-end next on the terminal tab in the better-lists directory, using `npm start`
6. The web app should open on the default browser, and you can start using it for your needs

## More about this project

I decided to make this project because I like to be organized, and I realized that the lists I had keeping track of
the movies, anime, and manga I read were a mess. I have simple bullet point lists for them on my iPhone's notes app, but
keeping track of my ratings for them, the genres, and when episodes aired or which chapter I read last made the lists
look cluttered and messy. I could have found an alternative notes app on the App Store or some other software, but decided
to make one myself.
